# Discover and install prebuilt plugins through marketplaces

> Find and install plugins from marketplaces to extend Claude Code with new commands, agents, and capabilities.

Plugins extend Claude Code with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugin marketplaces are catalogs that help you discover and install these extensions without building them yourself.

## How marketplaces work

A marketplace is a catalog of plugins that someone else has created and shared. Using a marketplace is a two-step process:

1. **Add the marketplace** - This registers the catalog with Claude Code so you can browse what's available. No plugins are installed yet.
2. **Install individual plugins** - Browse the catalog and install the plugins you want.

Think of it like adding an app store: adding the store gives you access to browse its collection, but you still choose which apps to download individually.

## Official Anthropic marketplace

The official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) is automatically available when you start Claude Code. Run `/plugin` and go to the **Discover** tab to browse what's available.

To install a plugin from the official marketplace:

```shell
/plugin install plugin-name@claude-plugins-official
```

The official marketplace includes several categories of plugins:

### Code intelligence

Code intelligence plugins enable Claude Code's built-in LSP tool, giving Claude the ability to jump to definitions, find references, and see type errors immediately after edits.

| Language | Plugin | Binary required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C/C++ | `clangd-lsp` | `clangd` |
| C# | `csharp-lsp` | `csharp-ls` |
| Go | `gopls-lsp` | `gopls` |
| Java | `jdtls-lsp` | `jdtls` |
| Kotlin | `kotlin-lsp` | `kotlin-language-server` |
| Lua | `lua-lsp` | `lua-language-server` |
| PHP | `php-lsp` | `intelephense` |
| Python | `pyright-lsp` | `pyright-langserver` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer-lsp` | `rust-analyzer` |
| Swift | `swift-lsp` | `sourcekit-lsp` |
| TypeScript | `typescript-lsp` | `typescript-language-server` |

#### What Claude gains from code intelligence plugins

Once a code intelligence plugin is installed and its language server binary is available, Claude gains two capabilities:

* **Automatic diagnostics**: after every file edit Claude makes, the language server analyzes the changes and reports errors and warnings back automatically. Claude sees type errors, missing imports, and syntax issues without needing to run a compiler or linter.
* **Code navigation**: Claude can use the language server to jump to definitions, find references, get type info on hover, list symbols, find implementations, and trace call hierarchies.

### External integrations

These plugins bundle pre-configured MCP servers so you can connect Claude to external services without manual setup:

* **Source control**: `github`, `gitlab`
* **Project management**: `atlassian` (Jira/Confluence), `asana`, `linear`, `notion`
* **Design**: `figma`
* **Infrastructure**: `vercel`, `firebase`, `supabase`
* **Communication**: `slack`
* **Monitoring**: `sentry`

### Development workflows

Plugins that add commands and agents for common development tasks:

* **commit-commands**: Git commit workflows including commit, push, and PR creation
* **pr-review-toolkit**: Specialized agents for reviewing pull requests
* **agent-sdk-dev**: Tools for building with the Claude Agent SDK
* **plugin-dev**: Toolkit for creating your own plugins

### Output styles

Customize how Claude responds:

* **explanatory-output-style**: Educational insights about implementation choices
* **learning-output-style**: Interactive learning mode for skill building

## Try it: add the demo marketplace

Anthropic also maintains a demo plugins marketplace (`claude-code-plugins`) with example plugins.

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**

```shell
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
```

**Step 2: Browse available plugins**

Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager. This opens a tabbed interface with four tabs:

* **Discover**: browse available plugins from all your marketplaces
* **Installed**: view and manage your installed plugins
* **Marketplaces**: add, remove, or update your added marketplaces
* **Errors**: view any plugin loading errors

**Step 3: Install a plugin**

Select a plugin to view its details, then choose an installation scope:

* **User scope**: install for yourself across all projects
* **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository
* **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only

You can also install directly from the command line:

```shell
/plugin install commit-commands@anthropics-claude-code
```

**Step 4: Use your new plugin**

After installing, the plugin's commands are immediately available. Plugin commands are namespaced by the plugin name:

```shell
/commit-commands:commit
```

## Add marketplaces

Use the `/plugin marketplace add` command to add marketplaces from different sources.

**Shortcuts**: You can use `/plugin market` instead of `/plugin marketplace`, and `rm` instead of `remove`.

### Add from GitHub

```shell
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
```

### Add from other Git hosts

Using HTTPS:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git
```

Using SSH:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add git@gitlab.com:company/plugins.git
```

To add a specific branch or tag:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git#v1.0.0
```

### Add from local paths

```shell
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
```

You can also add a direct path to a `marketplace.json` file:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/marketplace.json
```

### Add from remote URLs

```shell
/plugin marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json
```

## Install plugins

Once you've added marketplaces, you can install plugins:

```shell
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

> Make sure you trust a plugin before installing it. Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or other software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they work as intended.

## Manage installed plugins

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to view, enable, disable, or uninstall your plugins.

Disable a plugin without uninstalling:

```shell
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Re-enable a disabled plugin:

```shell
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Completely remove a plugin:

```shell
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

The `--scope` option lets you target a specific scope with CLI commands:

```shell
claude plugin install formatter@your-org --scope project
claude plugin uninstall formatter@your-org --scope project
```

## Manage marketplaces

### Use the interactive interface

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Marketplaces** tab to:

* View all your added marketplaces with their sources and status
* Add new marketplaces
* Update marketplace listings to fetch the latest plugins
* Remove marketplaces you no longer need

### Use CLI commands

List all configured marketplaces:

```shell
/plugin marketplace list
```

Refresh plugin listings from a marketplace:

```shell
/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name
```

Remove a marketplace:

```shell
/plugin marketplace remove marketplace-name
```

> Removing a marketplace will uninstall any plugins you installed from it.

### Configure auto-updates

Claude Code can automatically update marketplaces and their installed plugins at startup. Toggle auto-update for individual marketplaces through the UI:

1. Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager
2. Select **Marketplaces**
3. Choose a marketplace from the list
4. Select **Enable auto-update** or **Disable auto-update**

Official Anthropic marketplaces have auto-update enabled by default. Third-party and local development marketplaces have auto-update disabled by default.

To keep plugin auto-updates enabled while disabling Claude Code auto-updates:

```shell
export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=true
export FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS=true
```

## Configure team marketplaces

Team admins can set up automatic marketplace installation for projects by adding marketplace configuration to `.claude/settings.json`. When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code prompts them to install these marketplaces and plugins.

## Troubleshooting

### /plugin command not recognized

If you see "unknown command" or the `/plugin` command doesn't appear:

1. **Check your version**: Run `claude --version`. Plugins require version 1.0.33 or later.
2. **Update Claude Code**:
   * **Homebrew**: `brew upgrade claude-code`
   * **npm**: `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
3. **Restart Claude Code**: After updating, restart your terminal and run `claude` again.

### Common issues

* **Marketplace not loading**: Verify the URL is accessible and that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists at the path
* **Plugin installation failures**: Check that plugin source URLs are accessible and repositories are public (or you have access)
* **Files not found after installation**: Plugins are copied to a cache, so paths referencing files outside the plugin directory won't work
* **Plugin skills not appearing**: Clear the cache with `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache`, restart Claude Code, and reinstall the plugin.

### Code intelligence issues

* **Language server not starting**: verify the binary is installed and available in your `$PATH`. Check the `/plugin` Errors tab for details.
* **High memory usage**: language servers like `rust-analyzer` and `pyright` can consume significant memory on large projects.
* **False positive diagnostics in monorepos**: language servers may report unresolved import errors for internal packages if the workspace isn't configured correctly.
