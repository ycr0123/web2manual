# Extend Claude with skills

> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom slash commands.

Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.

> **Note:** Custom slash commands have been merged into skills. A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to control whether you or Claude invokes them, and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.

Claude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

## Getting started

### Create your first skill

This example creates a skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies.

**Step 1: Create the skill directory**

Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explain-code
```

**Step 2: Write SKILL.md**

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The `name` field becomes the `/slash-command`, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.

Create `~/.claude/skills/explain-code/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: explain-code
description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"
---

When explaining code, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
```

**Step 3: Test the skill**

You can test it two ways:

**Let Claude invoke it automatically** by asking something that matches the description:

```
How does this code work?
```

**Or invoke it directly** with the skill name:

```
/explain-code src/auth/login.ts
```

### Where skills live

Where you store a skill determines who can use it:

| Location | Path | Applies to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Enterprise | See managed settings | All users in your organization |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | All your projects |
| Project | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | This project only |
| Plugin | `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | Where plugin is enabled |

When skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win: enterprise > personal > project. Plugin skills use a `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace.

#### Automatic discovery from nested directories

When you work with files in subdirectories, Claude Code automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories. This supports monorepo setups where packages have their own skills.

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in
├── examples/
│   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute
```

#### Skills from additional directories

Skills defined in `.claude/skills/` within directories added via `--add-dir` are loaded automatically and picked up by live change detection, so you can edit them during a session without restarting.

## Configure skills

### Types of skill content

**Reference content** adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.

```yaml
---
name: api-conventions
description: API design patterns for this codebase
---

When writing API endpoints:
- Use RESTful naming conventions
- Return consistent error formats
- Include request validation
```

**Task content** gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with `/skill-name` rather than letting Claude decide when to run them.

```yaml
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy the application to production
context: fork
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy the application:
1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
```

### Frontmatter reference

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.

| Field | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | No | Display name for the skill. If omitted, uses the directory name. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters). |
| `description` | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Hint shown during autocomplete. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Default: `false`. |
| `user-invocable` | No | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Default: `true`. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active. |
| `model` | No | Model to use when this skill is active. |
| `context` | No | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context. |
| `agent` | No | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set. |
| `hooks` | No | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. |

#### Available string substitutions

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]` | Access a specific argument by 0-based index. |
| `$N` | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`. |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | The current session ID. |

**Example using substitutions:**

```yaml
---
name: session-logger
description: Log activity for this session
---

Log the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:

$ARGUMENTS
```

### Add supporting files

Skills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)
├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)
```

Reference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains:

```markdown
## Additional resources

- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
```

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

### Control who invokes a skill

By default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill.

* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`.

* **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn't actionable as a command.

| Frontmatter | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (default) | Yes | Yes | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |
| `user-invocable: false` | No | Yes | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |

### Restrict tool access

Use the `allowed-tools` field to limit which tools Claude can use when a skill is active:

```yaml
---
name: safe-reader
description: Read files without making changes
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

### Pass arguments to skills

Both you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

```yaml
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.

1. Read the issue description
2. Understand the requirements
3. Implement the fix
4. Write tests
5. Create a commit
```

When you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives "Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards..."

To access individual arguments by position:

```yaml
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

Running `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`.

## Advanced patterns

### Inject dynamic context

The `!`command\`\`` syntax runs shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder, so Claude receives actual data, not the command itself.

```yaml
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize changes in a pull request
context: fork
agent: Explore
allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)
---

## Pull request context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

## Your task
Summarize this pull request...
```

When this skill runs:

1. Each `` !`command` `` executes immediately (before Claude sees anything)
2. The output replaces the placeholder in the skill content
3. Claude receives the fully-rendered prompt with actual PR data

To enable extended thinking in a skill, include the word "ultrathink" anywhere in your skill content.

### Run skills in a subagent

Add `context: fork` to your frontmatter when you want a skill to run in isolation. The skill content becomes the prompt that drives the subagent. It won't have access to your conversation history.

> **Warning:** `context: fork` only makes sense for skills with explicit instructions. If your skill contains guidelines without a task, the subagent receives the guidelines but no actionable prompt.

Skills and subagents work together in two directions:

| Approach | System prompt | Task | Also loads |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill with `context: fork` | From agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) | SKILL.md content | CLAUDE.md |
| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md |

#### Example: Research skill using Explore agent

```yaml
---
name: deep-research
description: Research a topic thoroughly
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

Research $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:

1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep
2. Read and analyze the code
3. Summarize findings with specific file references
```

The `agent` field specifies which subagent configuration to use. Options include built-in agents (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`) or any custom subagent from `.claude/agents/`. If omitted, uses `general-purpose`.

### Restrict Claude's skill access

Three ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:

**Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`.

**Allow or deny specific skills** using permission rules:

```
# Allow only specific skills
Skill(commit)
Skill(review-pr *)

# Deny specific skills
Skill(deploy *)
```

Permission syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.

**Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter.

## Share skills

Skills can be distributed at different scopes depending on your audience:

* **Project skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control
* **Plugins**: Create a `skills/` directory in your plugin
* **Managed**: Deploy organization-wide through managed settings

### Generate visual output

Skills can bundle and run scripts in any language, giving Claude capabilities beyond what's possible in a single prompt.

Create the Skill directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts
```

Create `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/SKILL.md`:

````yaml
---
name: codebase-visualizer
description: Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of your codebase. Use when exploring a new repo, understanding project structure, or identifying large files.
allowed-tools: Bash(python *)
---

# Codebase Visualizer

Generate an interactive HTML tree view that shows your project's file structure with collapsible directories.

## Usage

Run the visualization script from your project root:

```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py .
```

This creates `codebase-map.html` in the current directory and opens it in your default browser.
````

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not triggering

If Claude doesn't use your skill when expected:

1. Check the description includes keywords users would naturally say
2. Verify the skill appears in `What skills are available?`
3. Try rephrasing your request to match the description more closely
4. Invoke it directly with `/skill-name` if the skill is user-invocable

### Skill triggers too often

If Claude uses your skill when you don't want it:

1. Make the description more specific
2. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` if you only want manual invocation

### Claude doesn't see all my skills

Skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available. If you have many skills, they may exceed the character budget. The budget scales dynamically at 2% of the context window, with a fallback of 16,000 characters.

To override the limit, set the `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable.
