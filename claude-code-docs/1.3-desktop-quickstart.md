# Get started with the desktop app

> Install Claude Code on desktop and start your first coding session

The desktop app gives you Claude Code with a graphical interface: visual diff review, parallel sessions with Git worktree isolation, file attachments, and the ability to run long-running tasks remotely. Work with local files, connect to remote machines over SSH, or run sessions in the cloud. No terminal required.

The desktop app has three tabs:

- **Chat**: General conversation with no file access, similar to claude.ai.
- **Cowork**: An autonomous background agent that works on tasks in a cloud VM with its own environment. It can run independently while you do other work.
- **Code**: An interactive coding assistant with direct access to your local files. You review and approve each change in real time.

> Claude Code requires a Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise subscription.

## Install

### Step 1: Download the app

Download Claude for your platform:

- **macOS**: Universal build for Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Windows**: For x64 processors

For Windows ARM64, download the ARM64 version. Local sessions are not available on ARM64 devices, so use remote sessions instead.

Linux is not currently supported.

### Step 2: Sign in

Launch Claude from your Applications folder (macOS) or Start menu (Windows). Sign in with your Anthropic account.

### Step 3: Open the Code tab

Click the **Code** tab at the top center. If clicking Code prompts you to upgrade, you need to subscribe to a paid plan first. If it prompts you to sign in online, complete the sign-in and restart the app. If you see a 403 error, see authentication troubleshooting.

## Start your first session

With the Code tab open, choose a project and give Claude something to do.

### Step 1: Choose an environment and folder

Select **Local** to run Claude on your machine using your files directly. Click **Select folder** and choose your project directory.

> Start with a small project you know well. It's the fastest way to see what Claude Code can do. Session isolation requires Git; without Git, all sessions in the same folder edit the same files.

You can also select:

- **Remote**: Run sessions on Anthropic's cloud infrastructure that continue even if you close the app. Remote sessions use the same infrastructure as Claude Code on the web.
- **SSH**: Connect to a remote machine over SSH (your own servers, cloud VMs, or dev containers). Claude runs on the remote machine with access to its files and tools.

### Step 2: Choose a model

Select a model from the dropdown next to the send button. You cannot change the model after the session starts.

### Step 3: Tell Claude what to do

Type what you want Claude to do:

- `Find a TODO comment and fix it`
- `Add tests for the main function`
- `Create a CLAUDE.md with instructions for this codebase`

A session is a conversation with Claude about your code. Each session tracks its own context and changes, so you can work on multiple tasks without them interfering with each other.

### Step 4: Review and accept changes

By default, the Code tab starts in **Ask mode**, where Claude proposes changes and waits for your approval before applying them. You'll see:

1. A diff view showing exactly what will change in each file
2. Accept/Reject buttons to approve or decline each change
3. Real-time updates as Claude works through your request

If you reject a change, Claude will ask how you'd like to proceed differently. Your files aren't modified until you accept.

## Now what?

You've made your first edit. Here are some things to try next.

**Interrupt and steer.** You can interrupt Claude at any point. If it's going down the wrong path, click the stop button or type your correction and press **Enter**. Claude stops what it's doing and adjusts based on your input.

**Give Claude more context.** Type `@filename` in the prompt box to pull a specific file into the conversation, attach images and PDFs using the attachment button, or drag and drop files directly into the prompt.

**Use skills for repeatable tasks.** Type `/` or click **+** → **Slash commands** to browse built-in commands, custom skills, and plugin skills. Skills are reusable prompts you can invoke whenever you need them.

**Review changes before committing.** After Claude edits files, a `+12 -1` indicator appears. Click it to open the diff view, review modifications file by file, and comment on specific lines. Claude reads your comments and revises.

**Adjust how much control you have.** Your permission mode controls the balance:
- **Ask mode** (default): requires approval before every edit
- **Code mode**: auto-accepts file edits for faster iteration
- **Plan mode**: lets Claude map out an approach without touching any files

**Add plugins for more capabilities.** Click the **+** button next to the prompt box and select **Plugins** to browse and install plugins that add skills, agents, MCP servers, and more.

**Scale up when you're ready.** Open parallel sessions from the sidebar to work on multiple tasks at once, each in its own Git worktree. Send long-running work to the cloud so it continues even if you close the app.

## Coming from the CLI?

Desktop runs the same engine as the CLI with a graphical interface. You can run both simultaneously on the same project, and they share configuration (CLAUDE.md files, MCP servers, hooks, skills, and settings).
