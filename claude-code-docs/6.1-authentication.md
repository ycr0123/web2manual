# Authentication

> Learn how to configure user authentication and credential management for Claude Code in your organization.

## Authentication methods

Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of these ways:

* [Claude for Teams or Enterprise](#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise) (recommended)
* [Claude Console](#claude-console-authentication)
* [Amazon Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock)
* [Google Vertex AI](/en/google-vertex-ai)
* [Microsoft Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry)

### Claude for Teams or Enterprise

[Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) and [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales) provide the best experience for organizations using Claude Code. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with centralized billing and team management.

* **Claude for Teams**: self-service plan with collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams.
* **Claude for Enterprise**: adds SSO, domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API, and managed policy settings for organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

**Steps:**

1. Subscribe to [Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) or contact sales for [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales).
2. Invite team members from the admin dashboard.
3. Team members install Claude Code and log in with their Claude.ai accounts.

### Claude Console authentication

For organizations that prefer API-based billing, you can set up access through the Claude Console.

**Steps:**

1. Use your existing Claude Console account or create a new one.
2. Add users through either method:
   * Bulk invite users from within the Console (Console -> Settings -> Members -> Invite)
   * [Set up SSO](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13132885-setting-up-single-sign-on-sso)
3. When inviting users, assign one of:
   * **Claude Code** role: users can only create Claude Code API keys
   * **Developer** role: users can create any kind of API key
4. Each invited user needs to:
   * Accept the Console invite
   * [Check system requirements](/en/setup#system-requirements)
   * [Install Claude Code](/en/setup#installation)
   * Log in with Console account credentials

### Cloud provider authentication

For teams using Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Azure:

1. Follow the [Bedrock docs](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex docs](/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry docs](/en/microsoft-foundry).
2. Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](/en/settings).
3. Users can [install Claude Code](/en/setup#installation).

## Credential management

Claude Code securely manages your authentication credentials:

* **Storage location**: on macOS, API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored in the encrypted macOS Keychain.
* **Supported authentication types**: Claude.ai credentials, Claude API credentials, Azure Auth, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth.
* **Custom credential scripts**: the [`apiKeyHelper`](/en/settings#available-settings) setting can be configured to run a shell script that returns an API key.
* **Refresh intervals**: by default, `apiKeyHelper` is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` environment variable for custom refresh intervals.
