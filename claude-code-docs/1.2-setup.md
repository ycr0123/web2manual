# Set up Claude Code

> Install, authenticate, and start using Claude Code on your development machine.

## System requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - macOS 13.0+
  - Windows 10 1809+ or Windows Server 2019+
  - Ubuntu 20.04+
  - Debian 10+
  - Alpine Linux 3.19+ (additional dependencies required)
- **Hardware**: 4 GB+ RAM
- **Network**: Internet connection required
- **Shell**: Works best in Bash or Zsh
- **Location**: Anthropic supported countries

### Additional dependencies

- **ripgrep**: Usually included with Claude Code. If search fails, see search troubleshooting.
- **Node.js 18+**: Only required for deprecated npm installation.

## Installation

**Native Install (Recommended)**

macOS, Linux, WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows CMD:

```batch
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

**Homebrew**

```sh
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically.

**WinGet**

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically.

After the installation process completes, navigate to your project and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd your-awesome-project
claude
```

> Run `claude doctor` after installation to check your installation type and version.

### Platform-specific setup

**Windows**: Run Claude Code natively (requires Git Bash) or inside WSL. Both WSL 1 and WSL 2 are supported, but WSL 1 has limited support and does not support features like Bash tool sandboxing.

**Alpine Linux and other musl/uClibc-based distributions**:

The native installer on Alpine and other musl/uClibc-based distributions requires `libgcc`, `libstdc++`, and `ripgrep`. Install these using your distribution's package manager, then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0`.

On Alpine:

```bash
apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep
```

### Authentication

#### For individuals

1. **Claude Pro or Max plan** (recommended): Subscribe to Claude's Pro or Max plan for a unified subscription that includes both Claude Code and Claude on the web. Manage your account in one place and log in with your Claude.ai account.
2. **Claude Console**: Connect through the Claude Console and complete the OAuth process. Requires active billing in the Anthropic Console. A "Claude Code" workspace is automatically created for usage tracking and cost management.

#### For teams and organizations

1. **Claude for Teams or Enterprise** (recommended): Subscribe to Claude for Teams or Claude for Enterprise for centralized billing, team management, and access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web.
2. **Claude Console with team billing**: Set up a shared Claude Console organization with team billing. Invite team members and assign roles for usage tracking.
3. **Cloud providers**: Configure Claude Code to use Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry for deployments with your existing cloud infrastructure.

### Install a specific version

The native installer accepts either a specific version number or a release channel (`latest` or `stable`).

To install the latest version (default):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

To install the stable version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s stable
```

To install a specific version number:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s 1.0.58
```

**Windows PowerShell - specific version:**

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) 1.0.58
```

### Binary integrity and code signing

- SHA256 checksums for all platforms are published in the release manifests
- Signed binaries are distributed for:
  - macOS: Signed by "Anthropic PBC" and notarized by Apple
  - Windows: Signed by "Anthropic, PBC"

## NPM installation (deprecated)

NPM installation is deprecated. Use the native installation method when possible. To migrate an existing npm installation to native, run `claude install`.

**Global npm installation**

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

> Do NOT use `sudo npm install -g` as this can lead to permission issues and security risks.

## Windows setup

**Option 1: Claude Code within WSL**

- Both WSL 1 and WSL 2 are supported
- WSL 2 supports sandboxing for enhanced security. WSL 1 does not support sandboxing.

**Option 2: Claude Code on native Windows with Git Bash**

- Requires Git for Windows
- For portable Git installations, specify the path to your `bash.exe`:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH="C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

## Update Claude Code

### Auto updates

Claude Code automatically keeps itself up to date to ensure you have the latest features and security fixes.

- **Update checks**: Performed on startup and periodically while running
- **Update process**: Downloads and installs automatically in the background
- **Notifications**: You'll see a notification when updates are installed
- **Applying updates**: Updates take effect the next time you start Claude Code

> Homebrew and WinGet installations do not auto-update. Use `brew upgrade claude-code` or `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` to update manually.

### Configure release channel

Configure which release channel Claude Code follows for both auto-updates and `claude update` with the `autoUpdatesChannel` setting:

- `"latest"` (default): Receive new features as soon as they're released
- `"stable"`: Use a version that is typically about one week old, skipping releases with major regressions

Configure this via `/config` → **Auto-update channel**, or add it to your settings.json file:

```json
{
  "autoUpdatesChannel": "stable"
}
```

### Disable auto-updates

Set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` environment variable in your shell or settings.json file:

```bash
export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1
```

### Update manually

```bash
claude update
```

## Uninstall Claude Code

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/claude
rm -rf ~/.local/share/claude
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\claude.exe" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\share\claude" -Recurse -Force
```

**Windows CMD:**

```batch
del "%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe"
rmdir /s /q "%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\claude"

### Clean up configuration files (optional)

> **Warning**: Removing configuration files will delete all your settings, allowed tools, MCP server configurations, and session history.

# Remove user settings and state
rm -rf ~/.claude
rm ~/.claude.json

# Remove project-specific settings (run from your project directory)
