- VSCode: Fixed slash commands incorrectly being executed when pressing Enter with preceding text in the input field
- VSCode: Added spinner when loading past conversations list

- Improved memory usage for `--resume` (68% reduction for users with many sessions) by replacing the session index with lightweight stat-based loading and progressive enrichment
- Improved `TaskStop` tool to display the stopped command/task description in the result line instead of a generic "Task stopped" message
- Changed `/model` to execute immediately instead of being queued
- [VSCode] Added multiline input support to the "Other" text input in question dialogs (use Shift+Enter for new lines)
