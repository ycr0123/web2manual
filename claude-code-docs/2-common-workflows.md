# Common workflows

> Step-by-step guides for exploring codebases, fixing bugs, refactoring, testing, and other everyday tasks with Claude Code.

This page covers practical workflows for everyday development: exploring unfamiliar code, debugging, refactoring, writing tests, creating PRs, and managing sessions. Each section includes example prompts you can adapt to your own projects. For higher-level patterns and tips, see Best practices.

## Understand new codebases

### Get a quick codebase overview

Suppose you've just joined a new project and need to understand its structure quickly.

**Step 1: Navigate to the project root directory**

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

**Step 2: Start Claude Code**

```bash
claude
```

**Step 3: Ask for a high-level overview**

```
> give me an overview of this codebase
```

**Step 4: Dive deeper into specific components**

```
> explain the main architecture patterns used here
```

```
> what are the key data models?
```

```
> how is authentication handled?
```

Tips:
- Start with broad questions, then narrow down to specific areas
- Ask about coding conventions and patterns used in the project
- Request a glossary of project-specific terms

### Find relevant code

Suppose you need to locate code related to a specific feature or functionality.

**Step 1: Ask Claude to find relevant files**

```
> find the files that handle user authentication
```

**Step 2: Get context on how components interact**

```
> how do these authentication files work together?
```

**Step 3: Understand the execution flow**

```
> trace the login process from front-end to database
```

Tips:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Use domain language from the project
- Install a code intelligence plugin for your language to give Claude precise "go to definition" and "find references" navigation

---

## Fix bugs efficiently

Suppose you've encountered an error message and need to find and fix its source.

**Step 1: Share the error with Claude**

```
> I'm seeing an error when I run npm test
```

**Step 2: Ask for fix recommendations**

```
> suggest a few ways to fix the @ts-ignore in user.ts
```

**Step 3: Apply the fix**

```
> update user.ts to add the null check you suggested
```

Tips:
- Tell Claude the command to reproduce the issue and get a stack trace
- Mention any steps to reproduce the error
- Let Claude know if the error is intermittent or consistent

---

## Refactor code

Suppose you need to update old code to use modern patterns and practices.

**Step 1: Identify legacy code for refactoring**

```
> find deprecated API usage in our codebase
```

**Step 2: Get refactoring recommendations**

```
> suggest how to refactor utils.js to use modern JavaScript features
```

**Step 3: Apply the changes safely**

```
> refactor utils.js to use ES2024 features while maintaining the same behavior
```

**Step 4: Verify the refactoring**

```
> run tests for the refactored code
```

Tips:
- Ask Claude to explain the benefits of the modern approach
- Request that changes maintain backward compatibility when needed
- Do refactoring in small, testable increments

---

## Use specialized subagents

Suppose you want to use specialized AI subagents to handle specific tasks more effectively.

**Step 1: View available subagents**

```
> /agents
```

This shows all available subagents and lets you create new ones.

**Step 2: Use subagents automatically**

Claude Code automatically delegates appropriate tasks to specialized subagents:

```
> review my recent code changes for security issues
```

```
> run all tests and fix any failures
```

**Step 3: Explicitly request specific subagents**

```
> use the code-reviewer subagent to check the auth module
```

```
> have the debugger subagent investigate why users can't log in
```

**Step 4: Create custom subagents for your workflow**

```
> /agents
```

Then select "Create New subagent" and follow the prompts to define:
- A unique identifier that describes the subagent's purpose (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `api-designer`)
- When Claude should use this agent
- Which tools it can access
- A system prompt describing the agent's role and behavior

Tips:
- Create project-specific subagents in `.claude/agents/` for team sharing
- Use descriptive `description` fields to enable automatic delegation
- Limit tool access to what each subagent actually needs

## Use Plan Mode for safe code analysis

Plan Mode instructs Claude to create a plan by analyzing the codebase with read-only operations, perfect for exploring codebases, planning complex changes, or reviewing code safely. In Plan Mode, Claude uses `AskUserQuestion` to gather requirements and clarify your goals before proposing a plan.

### When to use Plan Mode

- **Multi-step implementation**: When your feature requires making edits to many files
- **Code exploration**: When you want to research the codebase thoroughly before changing anything
- **Interactive development**: When you want to iterate on the direction with Claude

### How to use Plan Mode

**Turn on Plan Mode during a session**

You can switch into Plan Mode during a session using **Shift+Tab** to cycle through permission modes.

If you are in Normal Mode, **Shift+Tab** first switches into Auto-Accept Mode, indicated by `⏵⏵ accept edits on` at the bottom of the terminal. A subsequent **Shift+Tab** will switch into Plan Mode, indicated by `⏸ plan mode on`.

**Start a new session in Plan Mode**

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

**Run "headless" queries in Plan Mode**

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan -p "Analyze the authentication system and suggest improvements"
```

### Example: Planning a complex refactor

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

```
> I need to refactor our authentication system to use OAuth2. Create a detailed migration plan.
```

Claude analyzes the current implementation and creates a comprehensive plan. Refine with follow-ups:

```
> What about backward compatibility?
> How should we handle database migration?
```

> Press `Ctrl+G` to open the plan in your default text editor, where you can edit it directly before Claude proceeds.

### Configure Plan Mode as default

```json
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "plan"
  }
}
```

## Work with tests

Suppose you need to add tests for uncovered code.

**Step 1: Identify untested code**

```
> find functions in NotificationsService.swift that are not covered by tests
```

**Step 2: Generate test scaffolding**

```
> add tests for the notification service
```

**Step 3: Add meaningful test cases**

```
> add test cases for edge conditions in the notification service
```

**Step 4: Run and verify tests**

```
> run the new tests and fix any failures
```

Claude can generate tests that follow your project's existing patterns and conventions. When asking for tests, be specific about what behavior you want to verify. Claude examines your existing test files to match the style, frameworks, and assertion patterns already in use.

For comprehensive coverage, ask Claude to identify edge cases you might have missed.

---

## Create pull requests

You can create pull requests by asking Claude directly ("create a pr for my changes") or by using the `/commit-push-pr` skill, which commits, pushes, and opens a PR in one step.

```
> /commit-push-pr
```

If you have a Slack MCP server configured and specify channels in your CLAUDE.md, the skill automatically posts the PR URL to those channels.

For more control over the process, guide Claude through it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Summarize your changes**

```
> summarize the changes I've made to the authentication module
```

**Step 2: Generate a pull request**

```
> create a pr
```

**Step 3: Review and refine**

```
> enhance the PR description with more context about the security improvements
```

When you create a PR using `gh pr create`, the session is automatically linked to that PR. You can resume it later with `claude --from-pr <number>`.

---

## Handle documentation

Suppose you need to add or update documentation for your code.

**Step 1: Identify undocumented code**

```
> find functions without proper JSDoc comments in the auth module
```

**Step 2: Generate documentation**

```
> add JSDoc comments to the undocumented functions in auth.js
```

**Step 3: Review and enhance**

```
> improve the generated documentation with more context and examples
```

**Step 4: Verify documentation**

```
> check if the documentation follows our project standards
```

Tips:
- Specify the documentation style you want (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- Ask for examples in the documentation
- Request documentation for public APIs, interfaces, and complex logic

---

## Work with images

**Step 1: Add an image to the conversation**

You can use any of these methods:

1. Drag and drop an image into the Claude Code window
2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
3. Provide an image path to Claude. E.g., "Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png"

**Step 2: Ask Claude to analyze the image**

```
> What does this image show?
```

```
> Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
```

```
> Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
```

**Step 3: Use images for context**

```
> Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
```

```
> This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
```

**Step 4: Get code suggestions from visual content**

```
> Generate CSS to match this design mockup
```

```
> What HTML structure would recreate this component?
```

Tips:
- Use images when text descriptions would be unclear or cumbersome
- Include screenshots of errors, UI designs, or diagrams for better context
- You can work with multiple images in a conversation
- Image analysis works with diagrams, screenshots, mockups, and more

---

## Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them.

**Reference a single file**

```
> Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
```

This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.

**Reference a directory**

```
> What's the structure of @src/components?
```

This provides a directory listing with file information.

**Reference MCP resources**

```
> Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
```

This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format `@server:resource`.

Tips:
- File paths can be relative or absolute
- `@` file references add `CLAUDE.md` in the file's directory and parent directories to context
- Directory references show file listings, not contents
- You can reference multiple files in a single message (e.g., `@file1.js and @file2.js`)

---

## Use extended thinking (thinking mode)

Extended thinking is enabled by default, giving Claude space to reason through complex problems step-by-step before responding. This reasoning is visible in verbose mode, which you can toggle on with `Ctrl+O`.

Additionally, Opus 4.6 introduces adaptive reasoning: instead of a fixed thinking token budget, the model dynamically allocates thinking based on your effort level setting.

Extended thinking is particularly valuable for:
- Complex architectural decisions
- Challenging bugs
- Multi-step implementation planning
- Evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches

> Phrases like "think", "think hard", "ultrathink", and "think more" are interpreted as regular prompt instructions and don't allocate thinking tokens.

### Configure thinking mode

| Scope               | How to configure                                                         | Details                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Effort level**    | Adjust in `/model` or set `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`                    | Control thinking depth for Opus 4.6: low, medium, high (default)                                                    |
| **Toggle shortcut** | Press `Option+T` (macOS) or `Alt+T` (Windows/Linux)                     | Toggle thinking on/off for the current session (all models)                                                          |
| **Global default**  | Use `/config` to toggle thinking mode                                    | Sets your default across all projects. Saved as `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json`               |
| **Limit token budget** | Set `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` environment variable                        | Limit the thinking budget to a specific number of tokens (ignored on Opus 4.6 unless set to 0)                      |

To view Claude's thinking process, press `Ctrl+O` to toggle verbose mode and see the internal reasoning displayed as gray italic text.

> You're charged for all thinking tokens used, even though Claude 4 models show summarized thinking.

## Resume previous conversations

When starting Claude Code, you can resume a previous session:

- `claude --continue` continues the most recent conversation in the current directory
- `claude --resume` opens a conversation picker or resumes by name
- `claude --from-pr 123` resumes sessions linked to a specific pull request

From inside an active session, use `/resume` to switch to a different conversation.

### Name your sessions

Give sessions descriptive names to find them later.

**Name the current session**

```
> /rename auth-refactor
```

You can also rename any session from the picker: run `/resume`, navigate to a session, and press `R`.

**Resume by name later**

```bash
claude --resume auth-refactor
```

Or from inside an active session:

```
> /resume auth-refactor
```

### Use the session picker

The `/resume` command opens an interactive session picker with these features:

**Keyboard shortcuts in the picker:**

| Shortcut  | Action                                            |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate between sessions                         |
| `→` / `←` | Expand or collapse grouped sessions               |
| `Enter`   | Select and resume the highlighted session         |
| `P`       | Preview the session content                       |
| `R`       | Rename the highlighted session                    |
| `/`       | Search to filter sessions                         |
| `A`       | Toggle between current directory and all projects |
| `B`       | Filter to sessions from your current git branch   |
| `Esc`     | Exit the picker or search mode                    |

**Session organization:**

The picker displays sessions with helpful metadata:
- Session name or initial prompt
- Time elapsed since last activity
- Message count
- Git branch (if applicable)

Forked sessions (created with `/rewind` or `--fork-session`) are grouped together under their root session.

## Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history.

**Step 1: Create a new worktree**

```bash
# Create a new worktree with a new branch
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

# Or create a worktree with an existing branch
git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
```

**Step 2: Run Claude Code in each worktree**

```bash
# Navigate to your worktree
cd ../project-feature-a

# Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
claude
```

**Step 3: Run Claude in another worktree**

```bash
cd ../project-bugfix
claude
```

**Step 4: Manage your worktrees**

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
```

Tips:
- Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
- Changes made in one worktree won't affect others
- All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
- For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
- Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree

## Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### Add Claude to your verification process

**Add Claude to your build script:**

```json
// package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

### Pipe in, pipe out

**Pipe data through Claude:**

```bash
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

### Control output format

**Use text format (default)**

```bash
cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
```

**Use JSON format**

```bash
cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
```

**Use streaming JSON format**

```bash
cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
```

Tips:
- Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude's response
- Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
- Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn

---

## Ask Claude about its capabilities

Claude has built-in access to its documentation and can answer questions about its own features and limitations.

### Example questions

```
> can Claude Code create pull requests?
```

```
> how does Claude Code handle permissions?
```

```
> what skills are available?
```

```
> how do I use MCP with Claude Code?
```

```
> how do I configure Claude Code for Amazon Bedrock?
```

```
> what are the limitations of Claude Code?
```

> Claude provides documentation-based answers to these questions. Claude always has access to the latest Claude Code documentation, regardless of the version you're using.
