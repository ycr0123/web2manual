# Model configuration

> Learn about the Claude Code model configuration, including model aliases like `opusplan`

## Available models

For the `model` setting in Claude Code, you can configure either:

* A **model alias**
* A **model name**
  * Anthropic API: A full **model name**
  * Bedrock: an inference profile ARN
  * Foundry: a deployment name
  * Vertex: a version name

### Model aliases

Model aliases provide a convenient way to select model settings without
remembering exact version numbers:

| Model alias      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`default`**    | Recommended model setting, depending on your account type                                                                                                            |
| **`sonnet`**     | Uses the latest Sonnet model (currently Sonnet 4.6) for daily coding tasks                                                                                           |
| **`opus`**       | Uses the latest Opus model (currently Opus 4.6) for complex reasoning tasks                                                                                          |
| **`haiku`**      | Uses the fast and efficient Haiku model for simple tasks                                                                                                             |
| **`sonnet[1m]`** | Uses Sonnet with a 1 million token context window for long sessions |
| **`opusplan`**   | Special mode that uses `opus` during plan mode, then switches to `sonnet` for execution                                                                              |

Aliases always point to the latest version. To pin to a specific version, use the full model name (for example, `claude-opus-4-6`) or set the corresponding environment variable like `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`.

### Setting your model

You can configure your model in several ways, listed in order of priority:

1. **During session** - Use `/model <alias|name>` to switch models mid-session
2. **At startup** - Launch with `claude --model <alias|name>`
3. **Environment variable** - Set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<alias|name>`
4. **Settings** - Configure permanently in your settings file using the `model` field.

Example usage:

```bash
# Start with Opus
claude --model opus

# Switch to Sonnet during session
/model sonnet
```

Example settings file:

```json
{
    "permissions": {
        ...
    },
    "model": "opus"
}
```

## Restrict model selection

Enterprise administrators can use `availableModels` in [managed or policy settings](/en/settings#settings-files) to restrict which models users can select.

When `availableModels` is set, users cannot switch to models not in the list via `/model`, `--model` flag, Config tool, or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable.

```json
{
  "availableModels": ["sonnet", "haiku"]
}
```

### Default model behavior

The Default option in the model picker is not affected by `availableModels`. It always remains available and represents the system's runtime default based on the user's subscription tier:

| User type                     | Default model |
| :---------------------------- | :------------ |
| Max, Team, or Pro subscribers | Opus 4.6      |
| Pay-as-you-go (API) users     | Sonnet 4.5    |

Even with `availableModels: []`, users can still use Claude Code with the Default model for their tier.

### Control the model users run on

To fully control the model experience, use `availableModels` together with the `model` setting:

* **availableModels**: restricts what users can switch to
* **model**: sets the explicit model override, taking precedence over the Default

This example ensures all users run Sonnet 4.5 and can only choose between Sonnet and Haiku:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "availableModels": ["sonnet", "haiku"]
}
```

### Merge behavior

When `availableModels` is set at multiple levels, such as user settings and project settings, arrays are merged and deduplicated. To enforce a strict allowlist, set `availableModels` in managed or policy settings which take highest priority.

## Special model behavior

### `default` model setting

The behavior of `default` depends on your account type:

* **Max and Team Premium**: defaults to Opus 4.6
* **Pro and Team Standard**: defaults to Sonnet 4.6
* **Enterprise**: Opus 4.6 is available but not the default

Claude Code may automatically fall back to Sonnet if you hit a usage threshold with Opus.

### `opusplan` model setting

The `opusplan` model alias provides an automated hybrid approach:

* **In plan mode** - Uses `opus` for complex reasoning and architecture decisions
* **In execution mode** - Automatically switches to `sonnet` for code generation and implementation

This gives you the best of both worlds: Opus's superior reasoning for planning, and Sonnet's efficiency for execution.

### Adjust effort level

Effort levels control Opus 4.6's adaptive reasoning, which dynamically allocates thinking based on task complexity. Lower effort is faster and cheaper for straightforward tasks, while higher effort provides deeper reasoning for complex problems.

Three levels are available: **low**, **medium**, and **high** (default).

**Setting effort:**

* **In `/model`**: use left/right arrow keys to adjust the effort slider when selecting a model
* **Environment variable**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=low|medium|high`
* **Settings**: set `effortLevel` in your settings file

Effort is currently supported on Opus 4.6. The effort slider appears in `/model` when a supported model is selected.

### Extended context with [1m]

The `[1m]` suffix enables a 1 million token context window for long sessions.

> **Note**: For Opus 4.6, the 1M context window is available for API and Claude Code pay-as-you-go users. Pro, Max, Teams, and Enterprise subscription users do not have access to Opus 4.6 1M context at launch.

You can use the `[1m]` suffix with model aliases or full model names:

```bash
# Use the sonnet[1m] alias
/model sonnet[1m]

# Or append [1m] to a full model name
/model claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]
```

Note: Extended context models have different pricing.

## Checking your current model

You can see which model you're currently using in several ways:

1. In [status line](/en/statusline) (if configured)
2. In `/status`, which also displays your account information.

## Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables, which must be full **model names** (or equivalent for your API provider), to control the model names that the aliases map to.

| Environment variable             | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`   | The model to use for `opus`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is active.                      |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | The model to use for `sonnet`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is not active.                |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`  | The model to use for `haiku`, or background functionality                                     |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`     | The model to use for [subagents](/en/sub-agents)                                              |

Note: `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` is deprecated in favor of `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`.

### Prompt caching configuration

Claude Code automatically uses prompt caching to optimize performance and reduce costs. You can disable prompt caching globally or for specific model tiers:

| Environment variable            | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING`        | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for all models (takes precedence over per-model settings) |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_HAIKU`  | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Haiku models only                                     |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Sonnet models only                                    |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_OPUS`   | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Opus models only                                      |

These environment variables give you fine-grained control over prompt caching behavior. The global `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` setting takes precedence over the model-specific settings, allowing you to quickly disable all caching when needed. The per-model settings are useful for selective control, such as when debugging specific models or working with cloud providers that may have different caching implementations.
