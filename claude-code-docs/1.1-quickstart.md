# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
- A code project to work with
- A Claude subscription (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise), Claude Console account, or access through a supported cloud provider

> This guide covers the terminal CLI. Claude Code is also available on the web, as a desktop app, in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, in Slack, and in CI/CD with GitHub Actions and GitLab.

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

**Native Install (Recommended)**

macOS, Linux, WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows CMD:

```batch
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

**Homebrew**

```sh
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

**WinGet**

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically.

## Step 2: Log in to your account

Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `claude` command, you'll need to log in:

```bash
claude
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

```bash
/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
```

You can log in using any of these account types:

- **Claude Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise** (recommended): Subscribe to Claude's Pro or Max plan for a unified subscription that includes both Claude Code and Claude on the web.
- **Claude Console**: Connect through the Claude Console and complete the OAuth process. Requires active billing in the Anthropic Console.
- **Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry**: Enterprise cloud providers.

Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won't need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the `/login` command.

## Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

## Step 4: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
what technologies does this project use?
```

```
where is the main entry point?
```

```
explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:

```
what can Claude Code do?
```

```
how do I create custom skills in Claude Code?
```

```
can Claude Code work with Docker?
```

> Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context. Claude also has access to its own documentation and can answer questions about its features and capabilities.

## Step 5: Make your first code change

Now let's make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

> Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.

## Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
what files have I changed?
```

```
commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
show me the last 5 commits
```

```
help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## Step 8: Test out other common workflows

**Refactor code**

```
refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
review my changes and suggest improvements
```

> **Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.

## Pro tips for beginners

### Be specific with your requests

Instead of: "fix the bug"

Try: "fix the login bug where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials"

### Use step-by-step instructions

Break complex tasks into steps:

```
1. create a new database table for user profiles
2. create an API endpoint to get and update user profiles
3. build a webpage that allows users to see and edit their information
```

### Let Claude explore first

Before making changes, let Claude understand your code:

```
analyze the database schema
```

```
build a dashboard showing products that are most frequently returned by our UK customers
```
